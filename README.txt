 README:
 Please run the main file and give command inputs as follows:
  bin>java Main ur.txt -show -directions i5 CSB -meridianmap
 
 I have completed almost all the tasks
 My program makes the graph for all three maps almost instantaneously
 My program only makes the meridian map for 'ur' in logical time 
 My program gives out the shortest path to be taken with the distance travelled for all the maps
 
 I have multiple classes in my program:
 1. Main:
 Takes in the input and Initializes everything and calls the other classes.
 
 2. Dijkstra:
 class for Dijkstra's algorithm
 prints the path and also tells if path does not exist
 calculates the distance
 
 
 3. Intersection:
 makes all the intersections
 
 4. roads:
 makes the roads
 
 5. graph:
 makes the graph
 
 6. Minimumspanningtree
 uses Prim's algortithm to find the min_tree
 and prints the path
 seems to be nlogn however, with the bigger graph it goes beyond it 
 
 7. DrawMap:
 class to draw all the maps
